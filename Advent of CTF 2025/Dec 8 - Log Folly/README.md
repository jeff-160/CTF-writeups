## Log Folly

### Challenge Description

```
A quiet morning never lasts long at North Pole Security. Your console lights up with a new message from Jingle McSnark. He writes:

“Since you somehow solved my last challenge I made something actually secure this time. True discrete log strength. Unbreakable. And I even rotate the secret every round so you cannot rely on patterns. This is real cryptography human.”

The attachment is a small script and a long list of leaks. Snowdrift walks by, sees the file, and whispers

“He still keeps exponentiating the wrong thing”

You open the file. It takes about three seconds to realize Jingle has once again misunderstood what makes discrete log hard. Recover the hidden message before he starts bragging to the whole SOC.

DESCRIPTION:<h3><span style="font-weight: normal\;"><span>December 14<br><b
 r>Today didn’t go quite as planned. One of the toy-making machines jammed\,
  and glitter exploded everywhere. </span><span><span>During the cleanup\, I
  was asked to archive a special workshop document\, so I tucked the note aw
 ay carefully.</span><span> By the end </span></span><span>of the cleanup\, 
 even my ears were sparkling. Still\, we laughed through most of it\, especi
 ally when Jingle slipped and landed in a pile of tinsel. Santa says mistake
 s remind us we’re a team. I think he’s right. Christmas wouldn’t feel the s
 ame without a little chaos.<br><br>-Brindle</span></span></h3>

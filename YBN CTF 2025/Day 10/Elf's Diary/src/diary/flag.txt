December 25

It’s finally done. The last gift has been delivered, the tracks have gone quiet, and the snow outside feels softer somehow—like it knows the work is complete. I opened the final file this morning, hands still cold from travel, heart warm with relief. Everything worked exactly as it should.

As for me, this diary closes here — for now. Christmas has been successfully delivered, and it’s time for an elf to rest. 
Merry Christmas!🎄✨

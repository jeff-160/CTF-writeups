December 14

Today didn’t go quite as planned. One of the toy-making machines jammed, and glitter exploded everywhere. During the cleanup, I was asked to archive a special workshop document, so I tucked the note away carefully. By the end of the cleanup, even my ears were sparkling. Still, we laughed through most of it, especially when Jingle slipped and landed in a pile of tinsel. Santa says mistakes remind us we’re a team. I think he’s right. Christmas wouldn’t feel the same without a little chaos.

December 8
 
The snow outside is thicker than ever, but inside the workshop it’s warmer than usual, mostly because everyone’s rushing. We’re behind schedule on plush toys, so I stayed late to help stitch button eyes. My fingers are sore, but while organizing the inventory logs, I noticed a curious string scribbled in the margins:
1454512108090 _ _ _ _ _ _
It didn’t belong to any toy code I recognized. I copied it down just in case it is one of those things that will matter later. Mrs. Claus brought us hot cocoa and told us to pace ourselves. I nodded, but I kept sewing anyway.
